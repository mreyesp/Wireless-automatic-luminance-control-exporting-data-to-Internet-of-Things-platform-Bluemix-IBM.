First of all: The rest of the documents, diagrams, etc... will be uploaded soon. Please be patient :)
In the meantime i let you this description.

Wireless automatic luminance control, exporting data to Internet of
Things platform Bluemix IBM.

The purpose of this project is keep automatically, the luminance in a certain
"working range". The luminance and work state data are sended to internet,
and are processed using the IoT IBM platform.

- The chip MAX44009 was used to read the luminance data (bus I2C). Atached
to ESP32 wireless module.

- Luminance control using PWM on a high brightness LED. Programed on
ESP32 wireless module.
- An algorithm was designed and programed to automatic control the PWM
output, keeping the luminance in a given range. Programed on ESP32 wireless
module.

- The system send the data via TCP protocol over a WiFi connection. Pro-
gramed on ESP32 wireless module.

- A micro PC (BeagleBone Black) running linux, execute a python software,
who work as a bridge between the TCP connection and MQTT protocol,
forwarding the data to Bluemix IBM IoT platform.

- Node Red is used to get the data from Bluemix IBM IoT platform to visualize
them and also create a notication rule if the system is working out of the
given boundaries.

- An external system, based on a PIC microcontroller using PWM on a high
brightness
